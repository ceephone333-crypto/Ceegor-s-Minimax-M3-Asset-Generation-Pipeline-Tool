// renderer/sections/section23_Centralized_help_system.js (Phase 3 Block 29)
// Extracted: Centralized help system
// Source: app.js L224..444

// ----------------- Centralized help system -----------------
// Every option in the app (form field, button, settings toggle,
// context-menu action) has a help topic. Topics are keyed by a
// stable string ID; the help text is intentionally written in
// plain, non-technical English so a first-time user can
// understand it without prior experience with image / audio
// generation tooling.
//
// Two ways to wire a topic into the UI:
//   1. Inline `?` icon: pass the topic ID to `helpButton(id)`.
//      Clicking the icon opens the help modal.
//   2. Inline text only: pass an object with `{ text, topic }`
//      to `helpButton()`. The icon shows a 1-line hover
//      summary; click opens the same modal for the full text.
//
// The help modal is the same `showModal` primitive used for
// every other dialog in the app, so it gets the standard
// Esc-to-close + click-outside-to-close + focus-management
// behaviour for free. The "Got it" button is just the default
// `Close` action — the user can also press Esc.
//
// Why a central map (and not inline text everywhere)?
//   - One place to update wording when the user reports
//     something is unclear.
//   - Searchable: `grep '"topic\\.image\\.prompt"'` finds every
//     place in the renderer that references the image-prompt
//     help topic, even after the help text is rewritten.
//   - The `helpButton` factory always renders the same DOM shape
//     (consistent styling, consistent a11y title, consistent
//     click target).
