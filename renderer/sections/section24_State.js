// Extracted: State
// Source: app.js L25..223

// ----------------- State -----------------
// Phase 4 Fix 15: 'window.state' statt 'const state'.
// Vor dem Phase-3-Refactor war alles in app.js — 'const state' lebte
// in EINEM Script-Tag und war ueberall sichtbar. Nach dem Refactor
// sind die Files in SEPARATE <script>-Tags aufgeteilt, und 'const'
// am Top-Level ist NICHT global. Wenn imageTab/musicTab/section05
// usw. auf 'state.config' zugreifen, kriegen sie ReferenceError.
// Fix: state auf window exposen.
//
// Bug-fix #1 (2026-06-19): single source of truth for the persistent
// keys (window.STATE_PERSIST_KEYS). The previous renderer snapshot
// was hard-coded to 5 of ~18 fields, so every other state key
// silently reset to its default on every restart. The keys below
// MUST stay in sync with the shape produced by src/state.js write().
// `tabs` is special-cased (the renderer holds it as state.tabSettings)
// and is added to the snapshot before sending.
